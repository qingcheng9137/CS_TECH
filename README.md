#CS_TECH

Honestly speaking,maybe it's the most efficient way to learn computer
technology such as 'LinuxShell','Javascript','PHP','Network Security'
by experiencing.

In this repository,I will show several things below in each folder.
	1.Necessary codes shown by the materials.
	2.Notes written by myself or copied from the project.
	3.Relative learning materials from net.
	4.My forward steps onto Computer Science.
	5.All the things about computer science that I have met,
	  not only the technology.

Maybe it's not a good idea to put all my original codes and all my
computer learning trace in only one repository,but I like neat.

My detailed plans are given in the repository 'Mathphyg'.
By the way,it's the first year in my university.
Good luck! hahahahaha!
