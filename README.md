Honestly speaking,maybe it's the most efficient way to learn computer
technology such as 'LinuxShell','Javascript','PHP','Network Security'
by experiencing.

In this repository,I will show several things below in each folder.
	1.Necessary codes shown by the materials.
	2.NOtes written by myself or copied from the project.
	3.Relative learning materials from net.
	4.My forward steps onto Computer Science.

My detailed plans are given in the repository 'Mathphyg'.
Good luck!
